## kubernate completion

The `kubernate completion` command will output the text that can be appended to your `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc` for `zsh`, or the equivalent for your shell) file to enable command line completion.

The easiest way to add this to your shell is to run (adapt for your shell):

```bash
kubernate completion >> ~/.bashrc
```
